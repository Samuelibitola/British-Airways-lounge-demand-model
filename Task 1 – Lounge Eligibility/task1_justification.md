# Task 1 Justification – Lounge Eligibility Modeling

## 🧠 Background
Lounge access is a key part of the premium travel experience, and understanding lounge demand is crucial for **British Airways (BA)** to maintain high service standards while optimizing space and resources.

As BA prepares for future operations at **Heathrow Terminal 3**, it’s essential to anticipate lounge demand across various customer groups, each linked to different loyalty tiers and cabin classes.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
BA’s future flight schedules and fleet plans are dynamic, so the goal is to build a **flexible and scalable modeling approach** that forecasts how many passengers are eligible for lounge access on a typical day.

To support this, I created a **lookup table** that allows planners to estimate lounge eligibility percentages across different flight groupings. This tool enables forecasting even when exact aircraft or schedule details are not yet finalized.

## 🔍 Methodology
The modeling approach focuses on:
- **Grouping flights logically** (e.g., by time of day, route type, or destination region)
- **Applying eligibility assumptions** based on cabin class, frequent flyer tier, and partner status
- **Estimating proportions** of passengers who would likely qualify for lounge access within each group

These groupings and assumptions create a reusable framework that the **Airport Planning Team** can apply to upcoming schedules and scenario testing.

## 📈 Outcome
The final lookup table helps British Airways:
- Forecast total lounge users for any future schedule  
- Anticipate peak-demand periods  
- Identify where **new lounge investments** may be required  

---

## 💡 Impact
This model translates airline data into actionable business insights, helping BA deliver a seamless and efficient experience for its most valued customers while ensuring strategic use of lounge capacity.
